    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters. The resulting tokens are then passed on to some other form of processing. The process can be considered a sub-task of parsing input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are the most common words in a language like \"the\", \"is\", \"a\". These words do not carry important meaning and are usually removed from texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatisation (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form."
