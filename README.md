# News articles classification and clustering

In this repository we perform text classification experiments using Support Vector
Machines(SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Also, 
we perform text clustering using K-means Clusterer.

First of all, we create a data set from our documents. The input is 2225 documents
and the labels consists of Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport and Tech.

To sum up, the whole procedure consists of:

1) Create a data set of all documents
2) Text pre-processing
3) Generate Word Clouds
4) Vectorization
5) Classification and Clustering
